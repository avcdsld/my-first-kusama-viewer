# My First Kusama Viewer

DEMO: https://my-first-kusama-viewer.firebaseapp.com/

Based on the Substrate Front End Template, a viewer was created to display the latest block information (number, hash, parentHash, stateRoot, extrinsicsRoot) for the Kusama Network.

I have learned the basic usage of api. I'm thinking of extending it to include transaction information and more.
